# My personal site

This is the source code for my personal site, which is hosted at [acidop.codes](https://acidop.codes).
I made the design as minimal as possible, and I'm quite happy with it.

### Tech stack used
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for static site generation 🚀
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend 🎨
* [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the CSS framework 🖌
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for the React components 🧰
* [React Markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) for rendering markdown files 📝

### How to run locally
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/AcidOP/acidop.codes.git`
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Run the development server `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
5. Edit the code and the page will update automatically.
6. When you're done, run `npm run build` to build the site for production.
7. Deploy it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

# **NOTE**

* If you want to use this code for your own site, you will need to change `pages/about.jsx`, `pages/contact.jsx` with your details and put your own projects in `markdowns/projects/`.
